# The Museum of Dialectical Images
## A visual companion to Walter Benjamin's _The Arcades Project_

>"Ambiguity is the appearance of dialectic in images, the law of dialectics at a standstill. The standstill is utopia and the dialectical image, therefore, dream image." - Walter Benjamin, "Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century" (1935)


This project is an attempt to collect and display the visual references that appear in Walter Benjamin's _Arcades Project_. Largely composed of aphorisms and quotations from a variety of texts, throughout Benjamin's massive work he describes - often in detail - images that he discovered in the "Cabinet des Estampes" of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris or others that he encountered in exhibitions during his stay in the city. Throughout his work, Benjamin emphasizes the power of images to reveal or transform contradictions and possibilities. 

Print publications of _The Arcades Project_ - both the German edition (XXXX) and the English translation (1999) - feature just a handful of illustrations,  because of both the economics of print publication and the difficulty in tracking down these often-ephemeral objects. The broad digitization by global archives has made discovering many of the images Benjamin cited much easier. This project seeks to collect as many of these images as possible in an effort to imagine Benjamin's own encounter with the dialectical images that imform his work.


## Project Components

This project contains three components:
- The Museum of Dialectical Images, a collection of images keyed to passages in _The Arcades Project_
- Aufblitzen (Flash Up), a single random image from those collected
> "Articulating the past historically does not mean recognizing it 'the way it was.' It means appropriating a memory as it flashes up in a moment of danger" - Walter Benjamin, "On the Concept of History," Thesis VI (1940)
- Secret Affinities, multiple random images displayed together 
> "On the walls of these caverns their immemorial flora, the commodity, luxuriates and enters, like cancerous tissue, into the most irregular combinations. A world of secret affinities opens up within: palm tree and feather duster, hairdryer and Venus de Milo, prostheses and letter-writing manuals." - Walter Benjamin, _The Arcades Project_, R2,3


## Project History

This idea for this project was conceived by Brooks E. Hefner, Brad Pasanek, and Crystal Luo in the summer of 2020 during a (virtual) group read of _The Arcades Project_
